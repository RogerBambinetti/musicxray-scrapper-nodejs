According to Motif magazine, Lato's \"Rhode Island's next great pop recording artist.\" <br><br>His latest EP, aptly titled DO THE BEST WITH WHAT I GOT, recorded mostly in LA with co-writer/producer Jim McGorman (Avril Lavigne, Weezer, Cher) and co-writer/producer Steve Catizone over a two-month period, is the sound of Lato indulging the entire spectrum of his creative senses, from dance grooves to silky smoothness to proud power pop with hooks the size of Hoboken.<br><br>The music video for \"JUST ANOTHER GOODBYE\" has also been gaining traction and accumulating views in big chunks on YouTube (over 116,000 views!!) and Facebook, and is being aired on TV networks in USA and Canada (HD Net and the Cool TV). The video has also been added to over 1000 health and fitness clubs worldwide, and over 25,000 nightclubs, restaurants and retailers including Macy's and Ikea stores. Like its predecessors \"Beautiful Woman\" and \"Monday Morning Breakdown,\" \"Just Another Goodbye\" boasts a brilliant arrangement-strings, vocal harmonies, modern tech flourishes-to go along with its elaborate videography, and one uber-sexy model. <br>The song has also recently been placed in the feature film '16-Love', starring Lindsey Shaw from Pretty Little Liars and Chandler Massey from Days of our Lives which was nationwide in theaters in Jan 2012. The film also went to #1 on iTunes movie charts and spent 8 consecutive months in the top 10!!<br><br>Greg also writes for and develops other artists through his Talent Planning and Development company PUSH POP ENTERTAINMENT, has received awards from the Billboard World Song Contest, and written for MTV and A&amp;E network shows.<br><br>Greg has also co-written the theme song for the Gloria Gemma Breast Cancer Foundation titled 'I'LL GIVE YOUR WEAK MY STRENGTH' performed by Rob Marin and Kelley Lennon, which debuted in 2012 at their monumental Flames of Hope celebration and was featured in the PBS special 'Behind the Ribbon' in May 2013.<br><br>'HELP YOU OUT' is the powerful and attitude-driven single written by Greg and produced by Rich Mercurio/Lee Nadel, it boasts a brilliant arrangement mixing 80's Nile Rodgers with Rob Thomas pop sensibilities. The music video, just released in April 2012, already has over 110,000 views on YouTube!!<br><br>The anticipated new single 'THERE'S A SONG FOR THAT' written by Greg, produced by Rich Mercurio/Lee Nadel and mixed/mastered by Brian Malouf is out now. It has a universal theme of all the many things there is a song for, and the fact that everyone has a song that makes someone think of them. People from 8 to 80 can relate, when a certain song plays, there is a moment, time and place that evokes a memory which gives that song a special meaning in everyone's life.<br>The music video, released in April 2013, already has over 136,000 views!!"

        "extra": "Oliver Shaw is an Oxford-based songwriter, performer and producer. His main project Worldview aims to fuse the sounds of Indie and Dance music with insightful lyrics reminiscent of Elvis Costello or Morrissey and the melodic sensibility of the classic 60âs acts. Oliver began playing in bands, including one with Coldplayâs bassist-to-be, then spent several years honing a one-man band approach in his studio, writing, singing, recording and playing everything in the manner of Stevie Wonder, early Prince or World Party. He self-released a debut album, the relationship-themed âWar Yearsâ, in late 2002, culled from home sessions. It enjoyed some airplay and praise for the âtimeless qualityâ of the songwriting. A second set, âPaying For Itâ, followed in January 2005, with a more diverse stylistic palette and topics ranging from celebrity and consumerism to the Iraq conflict. The Oxfordbands.com website judged it âchock full of good tunes, clever lyrics andâ¦united by a consistent, if rather misanthropic, musical visionâ. As well as gaining FM and online radio exposure his tracks were featured on various unsigned compilation CDs. He appeared many times at major Oxford venues with a backing band from the ranks of other fledging local acts, and played some solo acoustic sets at London venues. Oliver then put together a new gigging line-up of Worldview, combining live instruments and PC, playing dates in Oxford and London, and an album, âOur Conditionâ, is available at the iTunes store and Amazon MP3. âWorldview's aptly titled \"Our Condition\" takes a snapshot view of modern living, with its raw honest exploration of life today...It's a strong offering with music that combines the ballads of REM with the dance beats of Duran Duran\" - Oxfordshire Music Scene. The Credit Crunch is the subject of download single, âPartyâs Overâ, which along with other Worldview tracks is a staple of Internet radio stations. It features on the new Worldview album \"Schoolboy Errors\", released in February 2012. Oliver also has a dance/pop songwriting/production side-project called Starmaker; the track \"Another Us\" was recently licensed to the Lucky Sounds label for a digital release. A third project is Desmond Chancer And The Long Memories, retro jazz-blues ballads, with two single releases on Villainous Records."

        "extra": "Norman Lamont is a singer/songwriter from Edinburgh in Scotland; he has been gigging there with a succession of bands since the late 90s. His current band The Invisible Helpers serves up anthemic rock with gratuitous violins. This song is a re-recorded version of a song from his 2009 solo album Roadblock.<br><br>'As the cover suggests, this is a darker set of songs, with themes of mortality and loss. The title track and The Spell speak directly about these, while Anywhere But Here shows a closed-down, depressed world and Come With Me a way out of it. It's not all gloom and doom, with typical wry humour showing through in Best of the Blues, I'll Be Back and When I Came Home From Egypt.' (Roadblock review)"

        "extra": "Since forming in 2007, Richmond, VA pop rockers The Jim Ivins Band have been making a name for themselves in the Virginia area and beyond, scoring rave reviews from publications like Absolutepunk.net and Property of Zack, while also garnering artist of the month honors from MuzikDizcovery.com and artist of the day at Fanbridge.com. They have also been fortunate enough to share the stage with national acts such as Parachute, Carolina Liar, The Rocket Summer, Cracker, The Ataris, Mae, Carbon Leaf, Pat McGee Band, He Is We and Every Avenue, as well as showcasing at the 2009 Miami Music Festival. Their latest offering, 2012's Everything We Wanted, showcases a maturity and expansion of their sound, from the delicate acoustics of love song \"Rollercoaster\" to the frenetic rock of \"Emergency\" and the sexy syncopation of \"Lost My Mind.\" Inspired by a recent show opening for rock radio favorites Switchfoot and The Airborne Toxic Event, Ivins decided to look farther inward when writing for Everything We Wanted, crafting a record soaked in introspection while touching on a myriad of emotions and situations like addiction ('The Sight Of Fire'), sex ('Lost My Mind') and moving forward after experiencing tragedy ('Everything We Wanted').\"<br>Proving themselves to be universally appealing, in 2010 The Jim Ivins Band signed a licensing deal with MTV. Their 2009 self-titled EP was engineered and mixed by Grammy Award-winning engineer Michael Congdon and features the song \"The Chance,\" a single produced by The Early November's Ace Enders that has caught fire on internet radio giant Pandora, racking up 160,000 spins and counting. Says Skope Magazine, \"whether itâs rock you crave or pop goodness that you desire, [The Jim Ivins Band] will satisfy all of your musical needs.\""

Music is music, it's one in the same, it's your choice to pick whatever artist or genre you feel you can connect with. No one should ever be or feel like they cannot express themselves without negative judgment. Same with love, there should be no limits in who we can be with or what love we wish to share. In hopes that someday we will live in harmony, we will live as one, under the stars we all will live in Perfect Unison. A perfect world filled with love and happiness."

She started school at the age 5 at Northwest Elementary School in a small town called Dodge City in the State of Kansas. There she officially learned to play the keyboard at the age of 6 along with other instruments. One day in her music class her teacher put on a movie about Ludwig van Beethoven. She was a little confused about his ways, such as an alcoholic &amp; angry man. Almost completely deaf when he composed his Ninth Symphony, which was done largely in his head without being able to hear it she was truly inspired &amp; amazed. Growing up she had many influences in music such as Shai, Jodeci, 112, Bone Thugs N Harmony, Usher, Mariah Carey, K-Ci &amp; Jojo &amp;&amp; many other big names in the genre r&amp;b/pop &amp; rap. Nadia moved to Nevada when she was 9 after the tragic death of her cousin which was 8 when he died near the Hoover Dam during a family vacation. Raised in Las Vegas, NV since 1999 the now 21 yr.old got involved with gangs at the age 11. She became a gang member of \"Bloods\" at the age of 13. Smoked her first joint when she was 13 not knowing in the long run she would into an addiction to other drugs. Trouble child in and out of juvenile her mother gave her up to the State &amp; became a foster child. With so much pain &amp; resentment she picked up a pen and notebook expressing all feelings and put her thoughts on a piece of paper. After awhile it became her way to vent. Ever since she has written over 100 songs genres r&amp;b, hip hop, pop, rap &amp; even country. Soon turning 22 her goal is to work with a few familiar faces in the music industry such as Drake, Rascal Flatts, Kanye West, Jamie Foxx, Bone Thugs N Harmony and many more."

He sang on numerous major advertising campaigns: British Airways, Smiths Crisps etc. He then went on to appear on albums by guitarist Gary Moore, Ringo Starr, David Essex, Jeff Wayne's album Sparticus, and an album \"Dear Anyone\" by Don Black and Geoff Stephens. He appeared on Top of the Pops with Justin Hayward (\"Forever Autumn\") and Elton John (\"I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues\"). In the 70's he had solo success as the legendary original voice on the Rubettes' world-wide number 1 \"Sugar Baby Love\", and his self produced and composed top 20 UK and European number 1 hit \"Your Baby Ain't Your Baby Anymore\". In the 80's he had a hit with Tight Fit, \"Back To The 60's pt II\" and has sold over 8 million records world-wide. He has also starred in the West End production of The Who's \"Tommy\" to rave reviews (\"Truly Exceptional \" - Time Out).<br><br>Paul's current show features the hits plus a wide range of classic music, (Motown, Swing, Rock and Pop) mainly from the 60's and 70's and featuring his amazing 3Â½ octave voice, and the showmanship you would associate with such a seasoned professional. Standing Ovations are a regular occurrence. Ask anyone who has seen him perform. Paul has recently played to capacity audiences at The Strode Theatre, Street and headlined The Somerton Arts Festival 2011, but is also performing in a wide range of venues, including intimate music venues, corporate, hotels, private functions, parties etc and has just returned from performing in Munich with the 15 piece Swing of Life Orchestra.<br><br>Paul has recently released an album of songs Da Vinci &amp; The Justice Dept which he has sung, written, arranged and produced and is available on itunes.  Paul is currently writing and producing and pitching material from his home studio."

        "title": "Mad Waltz",
        "extra": "At the age of 7 Ukrainian neo classical composer Sergey Rybytskyy was lured to the piano in a way similar to Edgar Allen Poeâs character in âThe Tell-Tale Heartâ was drawn to the heartbeat under the floor. That haunting call has never left Rybytskyy and instead of attempting to resist the attraction he allows it to run wild. In addition to this unrelenting passion Rybytskyy has taken the appropriate steps to fine tune his craft by attending multiple courses from Dnepropetrovsk Music College as well as receiving private lessons from talented musician and piano virtuoso Vladimir Skuratovsky. Rybytskyy was able to do this while essentially leading a second life as he completed engineering school and began a career to pay his bills in the mining engineer field. When Rybytskyy leaves the mining world he often enters into his own mental lair for song writing and recording.<br> <br>Rybytskyyâs musical influences cover a vast range from Alice Cooper to Marty Friedman. The primary drive of his music is to create an emotional experience for the listener that is original, lively, and refined. While the music would be used mostly for soundtracks commercially Rybytskyyâs music can actually tell a story by itself. Rybytskyyâs main instrument of choice is the keyboard but there are also a variety of other instruments used which allows a wide range of synthetic and authentic sounds that create a palpable atmosphere that invites the listener to escape into the musical world that Rybytskyy has created. <br> <br>Rybytskyyâs released his debut album âNew Vistaâ in 2012 to the welcoming arms of classical music, prog rock, and neo classical metal fans. The album was perceived as a work apart from the formulaic, stylistic labelings that most music in this generation falls under as the album swoons from ambient sounds to driving drums. Amped Sounds marveled at Rybytskyyâs ability to combine this wide variety of influences and genres to create a âmusical experience within itself.â Indie Music Digest stated that âNew Vista is definitely a dynamic and progressive musical statement that offers a lot of musical variety via vivid sound and brilliant creative energy.â<br> <br>A signal of the fervor with which Rybytskyy approaches his artistry, he wasted no time completing a follow up album by releasing âIn Labyrinths of the Soulâ later in 2012. This album was met with adulation as well. Multiple reviews of the album mention the ease of which the listener can get lost in the album. Rybytskyy surprised the Middle Tennessee Music blog with his ability to use the keyboard to make the sounds of many instruments and have it still sound authentic.  Hands Off Promotions remarked that the album sounds like âTim Burtonâs take on a classic.â<br><br>Rybytskyyâs unwavering drive will not allow him to rest. He has already been accumulating material for a third release in the near future. Future recordings of his will include prog rock versions of some of Beethoven and Bachâs compositions. Rybytskyy looks forward to the possibility of using a vocalist in some recordings as well in order to expand the diversity of his music. You will also be able to hear some of Rybytskyyâs work on television and film as he has recently signed deals with publishers and music libraries for commercial use.<br>"

I have known about these legends for a while and thought it would make a good song topic. Over the weekend i wrote and recorded this song. Just a note the forest is actually southwest of Tokyo not at the southern tip of Japan like i say in the song.  This is one of 3 mixes i did of the song. This one has the most going on . It may be better with just an acoustic mix. I went a bit crazy with drums on this. Hope you like it."

I had wrote the song a couple of years earlier  when i read a news article about a Canadian veteran who went into a government building and started shooting  at anything or anyone that moved. I mixed in  other stranger elements of horror and the book of the dead\" and came up with this song that attempted to get inside the head of a terrorist  killer. The song seems even creepier now because it was pre   9/11 and  other terrorist acts that the song seems to foretell.  The sound quality  is compromised because it was recorded from a cassette to an old   CD and the downloaded to a computer..After recording the song I sent it out to producers and record company's but .nobody was interested and no one ever got to hear the song.. until now. ."

RoYo began studying music, painting and drawing at a young age with local artists and was encouraged to develop his own unique vision, which combines GLBT culture, drag performance, personal spirituality, and a love for Old Time Gospel Music. RoYo is influenced by pop, rock, blues,gospel, country, and folk, but doesnât self-consciously follow any one traditionâ¦combining them all into some hybrid of his own."

With my trusty sidekick Chloe the Chihuahua by my side, I've been writing songs for many years now and it's my favorite thing in the world. I sincerely appreciate you checking out the tunes and I hope you like what you hear. Thanks for Your Time! Yours in Music, Glenn Page <br><br><br>About \"My Life in Pictures\":<br><br>Hey everyone - thanks for checking out my latest single, \"My Life in Pictures.\" I'm endlessly inspired by the topics of memory and loss, and the basic idea for this song stemmed from, of all things, a friend's digital picture frame (the kind that changes the image every few seconds). <br><br>It made me think of the ways we try to freeze moments in our lives and hold onto them and keep them alive in the present, even when they're no longer an accurate representation of the past. <br><br>It also made me think about, with the advent of things like youtube, the ways we are documenting more and more of our pasts almost to the point where the past and present are existing simultaneously. Of course, if you spend your present living in the past, what will you look back on in the future when you think about today? <br><br>I'm very proud of this song, and I hope you enjoy it as well. <br><br>Thanks, Glenn Page 4/9/12"

The rapper, stylist, artist holds 2 Associate of Arts degrees in Fashion Design and Fashion Merchandising. Known for his work ethic the full-time fashion designer and musician has released 6 mixtapes in the span 22 months. Creating all the artwork for each mixtape front and back covers. Balenciaga Banks is a rare American talent that is building a legacy in the entertainment and fashion Industries at the same time.<br><br>MUSIC: His first mixtape titled âThe Kat_Walk was released January 30, 2010 for online listen only. The mixtape has a mellow ear chalked full of fashion terminology. The smooth flowing mixtape over melodic beats prove to be good, yet different introduction. âThe Dapper Wears Monacoâ was released exactly 6 months later and was available for online listen and free hard copy hand out. This mixtape had great reviews as the designer/rapper did a remake of the movie âThe Devil Wears Pradaâ in hip-hop music form. The mixtape had excerpts from the movie at the beginning of each track, building a plot for what the song was about. January 4th 2011 marked the release of a 3rd mixtape by Balenciaga Banks titled âThe Heartbeat of Americaâ this mixtape drew critical acclaim. The rapper changed gears and left the F (fashion) OUT! Dedicated to his home state of Ohio. Balenciaga Banks online release saw huge numbers and downloads mainly by the newly acquired Ohio listeners who he longed to please. Just two months later the 4th mixtape dropped \"The Kat_Walk 2: Cambridge-vs-Oxford\". In an effort to build on the success of the previous mixtape a huge online initiative was the approach to back the new music. The rapper ran into a roadblock as the quickly released mixtape lacked the buzz that the previous projects provided and didnât do well via online listens. Four months later Balenciaga Banks dust off the microphone and released his 5th mixtape âCaviar and Cigarettesâ. The mixtape was a online only release and proved a successful comeback for the discouraged artist. Billed, as âEmotional-Rapâ Balenciaga Banks seemed to make himself vulnerable on the whole project. The first track âTwo Câsâ talked about his Cincinnati up bringing, grade school and fashion industry success. The listeners who wrote him off were back and gain a new respect for the Cincinnati, Ohio musician. Balenciaga Banks released his 6th mixtape âBlue Blood Chicâ December 15, 2011 available via online listen. <br><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/caviarandcigarettes/sets/blue-blood-chic\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://soundcloud.com/caviarandcigarettes/sets/blue-blood-chic</a><br><br>FASHION: Balenciaga Banks is working full-time for Perry Ellis International as a menswear designer.

The smooth flowing mixtape over melodic beats prove to be good, yet different introduction. âThe Dapper Wears Monacoâ was released exactly 6 months later and was available for online listen and free hard copy hand out. This mixtape had great reviews as the designer/rapper did a remake of the movie âThe Devil Wears Pradaâ in hip-hop music form.

The mixtape was a online only release and proved a successful comeback for the discouraged artist.

        "extra": " <br>Luiza Staniec has been playing the piano, singing and composing forever.<br><br>âI come from a small village tucked away in eastern Poland. Iâd always dreamed of going far, far away from there, exploring the world, performing my music, composing my songs and meeting different people. Music is my first language and my best friend. Since I found that piano at the community centre in my village when I was 6 years old, I knew what I was going to do for the rest of my life and which direction I was heading: <br>Music is my passion and my life.â<br><br>After finishing at the Music School Of Singers in Poznan, Luiza was a frequent performer on the Lublin music scene where she fronted the all-female band Matka (Mother) as the lead vocalist, pianist and composer. She also gave airtime to up-and-coming artists as a radio presenter for Akademickie Radio âCentrumâ (Student Radio âCentreâ) where she had her own show, Your Demo.<br><br>Soon she became a missionary of sorts, travelling the world with her musical message. Her âmissionâ took her to Japan where she lived for two years.<br><br>In 2004-2005 Luiza, together with Matka, collaborated with Micha? Wisniewski, a singer of great renown in Poland, on his project Red Head. Luiza still enjoys a considerable amount of success working alongside some of the best known Polish artists as a composer and lyricist. Her credits include one of Ewelina Flinta's best loved songs, Zaluje (I Regret).<br><br>In 2005 Luiza joined Telewizor, a Polish alternative rock band, to produce the album Sowy I Cmy (Owls and Moths) which enjoyed  great critical acclaim from the music press. This album opened the doors to some well known TV shows, one hosted by the hugely popular Kuba Wojewodzki. The song Plyne, Gine (Swimming, Drowning) was used in the TV movie Magda M which attracted a large audience. Her composition âSowy I Cmyâ (\"Owls and Moths\") found favour with the producers of another movie, Wieza (The Tower).<br><br>In September 2007, Luiza was a finalist in the prestigious Vena International Music Festival in Poland , sponsored by Pepsi. Her song Where Have You Been reached third place, having been immensely popular with the audience and judges.<br><br>In October 2007, Luiza released the album Ja To Ja (I Am Me), with eleven original tracks, all composed and arranged in Luizaâs own inviting style. This very feminine album exudes the warmth of Luiza's voice and the tranquility of her piano playing. The music on the album represents a unique life journey, with its many wonders and turns. Just like most of Luiza's songs, the material on Ja To Ja is as heartfelt and personal as an album can get.<br><br>Luiza, has been living in the North East of Scotland for more than three years, performing and composing.<br><br>She just recorded her five new songs with Grammy nominated producers Andy Bradfield and Avril Mackintosh, who have recorded with world famous artists such as Everything But the Girl, Tori Amos, Alanis Morissette and Tom Jones.<br>"

Anyways I have a deep passion for music, I started doing smaller things at age nine like school musicals and choir. Over time I got more obsessed with music production. I decided to become an artist at age 13 and started doing talent shows. My grandfather was an aspiring musician and died to make his dream come true, and I plan on doing the same. Music is my passion so it will always remain a part of me. Most of my friends would argue that music is more Kanye West styled but I would think that I am more like lupe fiasco,common,or Jay-Z. My story is still being written so don't hesitate to contact me to learn more"

It was during his college years that Paul got the songwriting bug, and shortly after receiving his diploma with a minor in Music, he moved to Nashville, TN. Paul spent almost 10 years in Nashville where he says: \"I had the great opportunity to meet some lifelong friends and play and write with some fantastic musicians. That time in Nashville in many ways is what brought me to where I am today - living a more \"creative\" life in New York City!"

Drawing influence from artists like Jon Foreman, Sufjan Stevens, and Ryan Adams, \"Late Night Drive\" sees Ivins take the leap into \"mature\" artist territory.<br><br>While love has always been the cornerstone of Ivins' lyrical story, his new EP sees him step his lyrical game up, touching on a more diverse set of topics, from self-reflection (\"Late Night Drive\"), to fear of the unknown (\"Riptides\"), to the tragic 2010 death of his mother (\"House of Three\"). \"I feel like when you make the songs this raw and intimate, it lends itself to making the lyrical content more personal, and that's exactly what's happened here,\" Ivins relates.<br><br>Setting out to create a songbook that's perfect for winter and driving in the dark, Ivins was ecstatic to finally have the material to contribute to a sound that's such a huge part of his musical self.<br><br>After releasing his solo debut \"99Â¢ Dreams\" on his own in September 2007, opening for Mae as his debut performance and CD release, Ivins formed The Jim Ivins Band with his brother Jack (drums), and friends Bobby Gary (bass), and Drew Martin (guitar). Ever since, the band have been making a name for themselves, securing a licensing deal with MTV, touring the east coast, showcasing at the 2009 Miami Music Festival, and opening for artists like Carolina Liar, The Rocket Summer, Parachute, and Carbon Leaf, among others, all while charming audiences young and old with their Goo Goo Dolls-influenced brand of acoustic pop rock. Their tunes even caught the ear of Jim's idol, Ace Enders (The Early November), who would go on to produce two tracks on their 2009 self-titled EP."

It will make you want to call your daddy when you are done. <br><br><br>Indie Nashville Songwriter / Recording Artist and Morro Bay California Worship Leader Chris Keith has 3 Cd's and is coming out with his long awaited 4th CD to be released October 1, 2012. <br> <br>Hits songs off his 1st. Cd \"He Took My Name To The Cross\" are \"Daddy Dance with Me\" A popular Daddy Daughter wedding dance song played at wedding's across the country, the new \"Butterfly Kisses\" or \"Cinderella\". Written for his daughter Tayler when she was 3 years old, she pulled on his shirt saying \"Daddy dance with me\" A song was born. Also title song \"He Took My Name To the Cross\" The most inspired Easter song in this decade! <br><br>The 2nd Cd \"Walkin'\" has hit songs \"I'm Afraid\" written after Chris' son Jesse had 4 needless brain surgeries, because his wife Shelene was not given a simple $25 GBS test at 35 weeks of pregnancy. Chris and his family changed the law nationally. Now, every pregnant woman in the US is tested for GBS. Also on the \"Walkin' Cd is the \"Sexy God song \"Song of Songs\" Chris wrote for Shelene on Valentine's Day. <br><br>The 3rd Cd \"Knockin'\" has hit songs \"Mary's Baby\" Played at churches and homes across America, it is the new \"Mary did you know\". And the touching 9/11 song \"In America\" shows that God still lives, and our flag still flies \"In America\". Like many fans across America; you will love and play Chris' Cd's over and over. Up lifting and Inspirational!<br>"
