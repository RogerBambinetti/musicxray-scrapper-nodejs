From a theme aspect we can intrepidly consider it as a concept album, dedicated to the ‘big figures’ of the polish and world cinema.<br><br>What comes to the music – the CD is very compact, enriched with dynamic patterns, creating a self-collage. Like a picture of a good director. Lebowski holds listeners in tension, changing the moods, playing according to emotions. Complex and multidimensional compositions, are enabling a surprising and dynamic plot. The entirety is completed with rich instrumental use and the whole ensemble is an interesting arrangement, where the music isn’t held from being in some cases asthetic, modest and soft.<br>Lyrics for the “Cinematic” are original quotes adopted from the classical polish and international movies."

For Rhett May Indian culture and music mixed with that from the west. <br> There’s no doubt Rhett May is back to music, and his latest single...'Cocktails and Cannabis' setting fire to music charts across the globe....is the harbinger of a new era in music that is unique and a breath of fresh air !!As one scribe puts it...\"It's hypnotic...it's exotic...a love song with an edge that goes round and round inside your head....very Haight Ashbury \"........<br>"

No Name and his half-brother were raised by their mother, a single parent...Observing countless days of his mother working, and giving her all to support him and his brother was all No Name needed to see and understand how the world really worked as a kid. Watching his family grow apart, and past friends walk away, as if his opinions and leadership skills did not matter, has affected his psychological growth, while maintaining as an eccentric/artful individual who sees todays society as what he calls the \"phony maze\". According to No Name, it is this phony maze that is causing too many families to grow apart and seek unfocused paths, because of monetary greed. No Name's lyrical content scrapes the surface of real life issues, to the depths of political and corporate scandal, racism, religion and cultural pride. His platform is sure 2 grasp the mind of the so called intellectual, while providing poetic confidence to those who feel the system has failed them. No Name's - poetic thoughts - stem from the bases that everybody matters. He feels that Americas current state is due to false leadership, given to those who primarily have backgrounds that include monetary means, which promotes respect or fear of those who dont have a gift for leadership... No Name's societal evaluation has produced metaphorical thoughts that when blended together with \"literal reality\", reveal that God's soldiers are the \"unappealing thugs\", who fight for and speak the truth for change! Will the world listen, or continue on the very destructive path it created? With an, B.Sc. in Industrial Technology, from Ball State University, his path so far has been purely spiritual. He fears not the phony maze, but those who see the tattooed thug as a threat. Choice of words tell the real story, and most of all- \"If I Have No Vision, Then Life Iz Just Talk\" - No Name N."

Matt and I have played in numerous ensembles for years from big band to small ensembles but, this is our first time working together in a duo setting. Matt is one of the most sensitive players I have had the opportunity to ever perform with. HIs compositions are both beautiful and poignant creations I had the pleasure to perform on this recording.<br>   All six of my compositions on \"In The Sky\" are very different in style or feel and all were composed for people and places in my life's experience. \"Miles Away\" was written while doing more than 10 years of road travel gigging in the 1980s. In The Sky is a circular melody that never seems to end. It was actually written while I was floating in the sky of a waking lucid dream. Sometimes dreams do come true and can become real music! \"Forever More\" is thru-composed love song written in the jazz waltz feel. It also has lyrics which I hope to someday record with a vocalist. \"Lionel\" is a traditional 1940s style jazz swing ballad composed as a tribute to my first saxophone teacher and mentor, Lionel Soares, who unfortunately passed away in July 2009. Lionel had a great influence on my life in music. This composition and performance recreates Lionel's style and grace as I remember him dearly. \"My Mama\" is a tribute to my Mom, Evie Britto, written in the traditional Cape Verdean rhythmic style called the Coladeira. \"Starry Eyed Girl\" is my take on the classic tune, Star Eyes, written as a tribute to my girl friend, Kathy Crowley, who is the female vocalist that brightens the stage in performance with the folk group, Pumpkin Head Ted.<br><br>LINER NOTES FROM MATT RICHARD:<br>   This recent collaboration with Rick Britto has been very positive.  We have known each other for the past twenty years and have played together in many jazz settings, but not as a duo until now.  Rick has an amazing technical capacity on the tenor saxophone but he also plays with a tremendous amount of feeling.  His interpretations of each melody are unique and well conceived.  Rick is also a very good jazz pianist and that kept me on my toes for this session.  I appreciate his ability to not only compose and perform this project but to record and edit it as well.<br>   I consider all five of my compositions on \"In The Sky\" fairly straight-ahead in form, melody, and harmony.  The rhythms are based on traditional swing, Latin-American, and ballad styles with plenty of space in which can players can improvise. \"Side Step\" has loose connections to Lee Morgan’s composition \"Ceora\".  It was inspired by the original introduction that I used for that song on my first CD. \"Past\" was originally written and set in a different key as part of a collection of duets that I wrote for the bassist Bronek Suchanek.  This song and that complete duo project will hopefully be recorded someday soon. The choro rhythm of \"Strait Ahead\" is typically Brazilian and the feel of this song came through listening to pianist Alan Pasqua’s composition Highway as well as the music of composer and bandleader Maria Schneider. \"Swingin’ At The Columns\" is a tribute to two of my favorite jazz musicians of all time, Dave McKenna and Dick Johnson, who performed at a club called The Columns on Cape Cod for many years. Finally, \"A Song For Semenya\" was influenced by my collaborations over the years with jazz vocalist Semenya McCord.  Although in meter of 3/4, it has a bit of Horace Silver’s Song For My Father and other gospel roots in it.<br>"

Devin Messina Creative minds can’t be bottled in and they must wander freely through, soaking up as much as they can. Devin Messina is no exception. Born in Maryland, Devin’s broad upbringing has allowed her to witness the good and the bad of the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Music was her therapy, and despite her circumstances, she used melody to get through whatever was in her way. Devin first knew that she wanted to perform when she was only 10 years old. Locking the door, and performing in her room, she wrote her first song when she was 12. These early writings were reminiscent of the things that she’d been going through as a youngster. Devin’s drive was apparent very early on. She was able to record in a studio by the age of 12 with her first group, Girl’s In Full Effect (G.I.F.E.). While singing in talent shows in and around DC, Devin also sang in her school choirs and had the opportunity to sing the National Anthem for basketball games. While attending Fort Washington’s Friendly High School, Devin formed a group named “Elation”. After high school, the group started working on an album with producers K.C and Rich Harris. The group would spend days in the studio until they had their songs perfect. Over time the group would experience great creative differences, freeing Devin to pursue her dreams of being a solo artist. Despite her humble beginnings, Devin has been able to make a name for herself in the entertainment industry. She’s worked with very talented producers, like Rich Harris, Lex-D of Bloq Rockaz Production, and Mac Ming. She’s also opened up for artist like Beanie Man, A.Z., Chuck Brown, Marcus Johnson and Trey Songz. She’s also sang the National Anthem at a National Basketball Association Indiana Pacers game. In addition, her talent has given her a chance to perform at very prestigious venues, like the Lincoln Theater, Warner Theater, and Blues Alley. Inspired by Jimmy Hendrix, Bootsy Collins, Betty Davis, Smokey Robinson, Sam Cook, Aretha Franklin, Donnie Hathaway, Michael Jackson, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin, Devin consults a vast library of musical geniuses. Her style is a perfect blend of funk, soul, rock, and pop, and she strives to create music that is similar to nothing else that’s currently being done. A true artist in every sense of the word, Devin spends her spare time perfecting her other creative talents. She enjoys creating abstract drawings, writing, and cosmetology. She is passionate about everything that she touches and works on. Devin hopes to pursue a career in acting in theater and on screen. She also would love to start a clothing line, which would display some of her abstract drawings. From homelessness, to death, to broken hearts, to love pains, Devin’s life is filled with experiences that her listeners can relate to. She has a story to tell, and she hopes that people can learn from the things that she’s experience through her passionate music. “The negative life experiences that you go through shouldn’t dictate your future,” Devin proclaims, “everything happens for a reason, so just live life and learn from it all.” We hope that the world will soon be able to learn through Ms. Devin Messina."

They have previously worked together in various bands and music projects, but the current set “Steve Misik &amp; Co.” settled in April 2013 during the recording of the songs for the debut album “Schizoemphatic” and creating the promo video for the cover version of Deep Purple's ¨You Keep On Moving¨.<br><br>The way in which we got to the recording of the debut album was very long and difficult. The first single because of the web administrator's mistake was promoted with incorrect band name “Clone co.”, because he entered the name of the single instead the name of the band, so we kicked his ass.<br><br>When the band worked on new songs for the debut album faced with the biggest misfortune, with the health problems of the lead guitarist and co-founder of the band and especially a good friend. Steve Tóth had to be hospitalized. Steve Misik had to play abroad as a session musician in different projects, because of the break and money required for recording and so on. That time Steve Tóth suddenly passed away, which painfully affected everybody, because of his creative benefit, friendship and enormous love for music (when he found out that he will not be able to play guitar after his heart surgery, he fell into a coma and doctors failed to wake him). Steve Misik composed and arranged the song \"My waves\" based on his riff and lyrics, they worked together on that song before his death. The album Schizoemphatic is dedicated to his memory.<br>The band doesn't like to label its genre. We grew up listening hard rock, metal bands but we've been influenced by funk, soul, blues, classical music or jazz. Our music is based on the concept of trying different genres, different imaginary worlds, different fantasies in every song but keeping our own face. In the lyrics we point out the civilization problems of the society and mental world of the human being. That's how we define our music direction in the media interviews.<br>"

At age 11, in the Summer of 1978, I was a member of the Cleveland Orchestra Boy's Choir performing Carl Orff's \"Carmina Burana\" at Blossom Music and am hopeful this isn’t my only 15 minutes of fame in life. Got my first electric guitar from a garage sale at age 16 and taught myself how to play Stairway to Heaven since it just didn't sound right on piano. <br><br>After completing two years at Thee Ohio State University's School of Music, decided to move to Hollywood, California in July of 1989 and graduated from Musician's Institute/Guitar Institute of Technology - actually quite an accomplishment considering the vast majority didn't. Was signed to Rag Records with my band, The Mustard Seeds and as a producer for the band, Treehouse Toys for Planet Earth Records. While on Planet Earth, played at the first anniversary of 9/11 for a benefit promoted by KROQ. Even licensed Music to Playboy Entertainment for their cable channel that gave me a certain infamous reputation around town. Took my first stab at composing to film when I composed Title and Credit Cues for the Independent Film, \"Man's Best Friend\" (Maxwell Productions). Signed a Development Deal with the Entertainment Law Firm, Madison Law Group (my first dealing with entertainment lawyers) and produced a ballad for recording artist, Satori. Signed a Development Deal with Cornerstone Studios (Fleetwood Mac, Motley Crue) to produce vocalist, Tami Johnson. Went back to school at UCLA Extension School's Film Scoring Certificate Program and composed for Chamber Orchestras, Small Ensembles, Quintets, Quartets, and Trios that I do consider my greatest educational experience to date. <br><br>In May of 2003, I moved back to The FarEast Side of Cleveland, Ohio because of a family tragedy and created WhitedOut Productions &amp; Studio on Murray Hill producing seven Cds for commercial release including Jim Miller’s double CD, In-Trance-It: an absolute thrill since I have been following him since Oroboros. Considering the fact that my recording studio was in an art gallery building, performed live at Murray Hill Art Walks, SPARX Gallery Hops, and Fashion Shows. Performed with vocalist, Susan Fletcher at The Abbey Road on the River Festival in Louisville, KY and Louise Harrison, George's sister, complimented us for our version of \"Imagine\". Got back into Film/Television composing and contributed music to the Cleveland-based television series, \"Out of Darkness\" including the Main Theme (see YouTube interview above). Then went on to produce the Cd entitled, \"HARP ROCK\" for Harpist, Christina Kline performing 14 Classic Rock standards that never sound so serene. Also produced Christina's harp version of ZZ Top’s, “Gimme All Your Lovin’ ” for the FOX Television show, “BONES” and learned a lot about The Industry through dealings with Fox's Music division. Was thrilled when Northern Ohio Live Magazine’s television show, “Live from the Circle” used my song, \"Cool Jazz for Ma'\" for their main theme for a 13 week run on PBS. Played solo two years in a row at the Let's Get Together Festival in a natural amphitheater in Central, PA and have decided playing at outdoor music festivals is the way to go. <br><br>Then in 2012, moved back to HollyWeird and out there, I am know as a \"he played a mean guitar\" and formed my first cover band, The WizGuys. Got to jam a Zep medley of Whole Lotta Love/The Lemon Song/Bring On Home in the old clubs I used to play in with The Mustard Seeds - a total kick. But, there is a reason why Axl wrote, \"Welcome To The Jungle\" and I got the hell outta Dodge. <br><br>Returned back to the Cleveland area in 2014 and became the keyboardist at Unity Center of the Heights which not only enhanced my performance skills, but my Spiritual skills as well. Formed a cover band that we play the first part of a cover, then jam on it for an undetermined amount of time. And now I am concentrating on my Cool Jazz &amp; R&amp;B music plus a new cover band with electric rock harpist Kristy Kline entitled - Into The Light: A Pink Floyd Experience that Kristy sings and plays harp to!"

        "extra": "Craymo BIO<br><br>Craymo was born Craig Stephen Raymo in Massena, New York and grew up in nearby Ogdensburg, a quiet little city on the St. Lawrence River bordering Canada. Music seemed to possess his soul from an early age as he had always tried to imitate the singers and bands eminating from his little 45 rpm record player. In 3rd grade he picked up the alto saxophone taking lessons from Kenneth Van Winkle, father of future Grammy winner Dixon Van Winkle. Craymo continued taking lessons and played in elementary and Jr. and Sr.High Bands and the school Jazz Rock group. Craig wrote his first song when he was 16. He sang in the school choir from elementary through high school. The young performer craved the stage and graced it every chance he got joining the local vaudeville style minstrel group Showtime. Craymo performed in community theatre and high school drama and musical theatre productions. <br>As a senior in high school he took interest in DJing and got a job spinning at Big Ed's Dallas Lounge and also at a local radio station where co-workers first started calling him Craymo. Craymo went to Fredonia State University majoring in Broadcasting with a minor in drama. <br><br>Feeling the call of the big city, Craig left college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dreams. He soon landed acting gigs in the TV soap operas General Hospital and days Of Our livess, most recently in the HBO original film Recount. Craymo continued to DJ in Nightclubs and was one of the first \"video jocks\" to beat mix videos! All the while focused on his music Craymo wrote hundreds of songs and started recording demos in Los Angeles recording studios. He auditioned to be the lead singer for several bands but ultimately realized his destiny was to be a solo artist. The determined young man took vocal lessons with R&amp;B great Bobby Womack and recorded a demo of one of his songs. Craymo then met record producer David Longoria who took him under his wing and they recorded his first professionally recorded song Love Touch and filmed his first music video. Then they went on to create several more songs including Craymo's first EP entitled Be My Girl who's title track was licensed in the indie film Paper Thin Immortals. The next video was Take It Slow with a sixties beatnick vibe and the song was licensed in the indie film Accidents Don't Happen. Craymo appeared as a male vocalist on Star Search 89 with Ed McMahan. He formed several backup bands performing at the Whiskey A Go Go, The Roxy, Genghis Cohen and opened up shows for Smashmouth, The Plimsouls and Fishbone. He then met record producer Chris Irwin and recorded several songs in his Malibu studio. Craymo then ran into his old friend, songwriter and producer Brandon Jarrett. They went into the studio and magic happened. Combining their song catalogs into one company, Moho Productions, LLC. They recorded One Love One World which became a worldwide phenomenon being featured on the United Nations project UNESCO web site <a href=\"http://www.newsongsforpeace.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.newsongsforpeace.org</a>. School teachers all over the world downloaded the song, taught it to their students who then performed it at their schools in the USA, Canada, China and Australia! <br><br>Craymo has been a semi-finalist and finalist in several songwriting competitions including the 2014 Hollywood Music In Media Awards, 2014 Right Out TV Awards, 2014 Indie Music Channel Awards, 2014 Independent Music Network Awards (Winner New Discovery Artist), 2014 UK Songwriting Competition and the 2012 Australian Music Oz Awards. His songs have been licensed in the indie films, Culture Shock, Gabe The Cupid Dog, Super Southern Sweet Sixteen, Silly Movie 2 and Successful Failures 2. Also in television including The Mysteries Of Laura,  The X Games<br>( ESPN), Dance Mom's (TLC), The Orlando Citrus Parade, Sinbad's Reality U (pilot), Toddlers and Tiaras (TLC) and Chris and John To The Rescue (Canada).

Music seemed to possess his soul from an early age as he had always tried to imitate the singers and bands eminating from his little 45 rpm record player.  In 3rd grade he picked up the alto saxophone taking lessons from Kenneth Van Winkle, father of future Grammy winner producer Dixon Van Winkle. Craymo continued taking lessons and played in elementary and Jr. and Sr.High Bands and the school Jazz Rock group. Craig wrote his first song when he was 16.  He sang in the school choir from elementary through high school.  The young performer craved the stage and graced it every chance he got joining the local vaudeville style minstrel group Showtime. Craymo performed in community theatre and high school drama and musical theatre productions.<br>As a senior in high school he took interest in DJing and got a job spinning at Big Ed's Dallas Lounge and also at a local radio station where co-workers first started calling him Craymo.  Craymo went to Fredonia State University majoring in Broadcasting with a minor in drama."

Then when Hurricane Katrina hit, many My Space fans answered my call when I created the Paul Caroul Challenge: a pledge to follow my lead and give half of what you own to help the victims get back on their feet. So many wonderful people donated stuff that I could give to the right places to expedite the process. I later located one gal who came to CA with her car and the shirt off her back after losing everything- and around the country Madison Paige fans sent gift cards, goods, etc. and together we were able to help furnish her new dwellings. Everyone who would gave half, I pledged that I would record a specialty CD for and it is now done exclusively for them and a few of my friends. It took just under two years in between my Madison Paige recordings. My heart was warmed by others' generosity to help, and so the project truly became a Labor Of Love. \" Quote: -Paul Caroul February 2007<br><br>"

One of these concerts was Satsup Tin Cup Races in Olympia, Washington, then we came down and played Portland, Oregon, San Fransisco, California and then ended up in Hollywood in early 1971. I was the founder of the Johnathan Davis Group. I wrote all the songs and was the lead singer. I played in Hollywood in the 70's, was on KTTV, The Elliot Mence show, I played on KPFK Live after 12:00, I did a Griffith Park concert with El Chicano and played many living room concerts for the rich and famous I also played The Trubador and Filthy McNasty's. The Johnathan Davis Group was the only group ever to play live on KMET at that time. Recorded at Fat chance, Columbia Studio D and at their showcase, also recorded at Paramount Studios, where i met Frank Zappa and his family, Played these clubs outside The L.A. area, Finicans Rainbow, The In Crowd ,The Golden Bear are just a few of the clubs I played in. I have been on the same shows with Steve Miller Band, The Youngbloods, Bad Company, Big Foot, Little Feet, El Chicano, Ike and Tina Turner, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Linda Ronstadt, Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids, John Hammond, Country Joe and the Fish and many more that I can't recall. Gene Borges had my back- he was the owner of Sunset Transit Classic Cars down by The Hyatt House and he showed me the best of Hollywood. My best friend was Michael Todd, Elizabeth Taylors son. Mike was delivering gold for Howard Hughes. Mike introduced me to him and we were the ones who took Liz's fragrance White Diamonds to the manufacturer. I ended up selling a Rolls Royce to Wilt Chamberlain and I met Ricky Nelson and his two sons there on the car lot. I burned a fat one with Buddy Miles. It was the early '70's, what can I say, ya know? I met Cindy Lauper, we hung out for a day. I also met David Bowie. Thanks goes out all my fans old and new :)"

One of these concerts was Satsup Tin Cup Races in Olympia, Washington, then we came down and played Portland, Oregon, San Fransisco, California and then ended up in Hollywood in early 1971. I was the founder of the Johnathan Davis Group. I wrote all the songs and was the lead singer. I played in Hollywood in the 70's, was on KTTV, The Elliot Mence show, I played on KPFK Live after 12:00, I did a Griffith Park concert with El Chicano and played many living room concerts for the rich and famous I also played The Trubador and Filthy McNasty's. The Johnathan Davis Group was the only group ever to play live on KMET at that time. Recorded at Fat chance, Columbia Studio D and at their showcase, also recorded at Paramount Studios, where i met Frank Zappa and his family, Played these clubs outside The L.A. area, Finicans Rainbow, The In Crowd ,The Golden Bear are just a few of the clubs I played in. I have been on the same shows with Steve Miller Band, The Youngbloods, Bad Company, Big Foot, Little Feet, El Chicano, Ike and Tina Turner, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Linda Ronstadt, Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids, John Hammond, Country Joe and the Fish and many more that I can't recall. Gene Borges had my back- he was the owner of Sunset Transit Classic Cars down by The Hyatt House and he showed me the best of Hollywood. My best friend was Michael Todd, Elizabeth Taylors son. Mike was delivering gold for Howard Hughes. Mike introduced me to him and we were the ones who took Liz's fragrance White Diamonds to the manufacturer. I ended up selling a Rolls Royce to Wilt Chamberlain and I met Ricky Nelson and his two sons there on the car lot. I burned a fat one with Buddy Miles. It was the early '70's, what can I say, ya know? I met Cindy Lauper, we hung out for a day. I also met David Bowie. Thanks goes out all my fans old and new :)"

We make music that people can relate to on many different levels... think about it... chill to it... dance to it... make love to it... funky, modern, relevant lyrics and tunes, set to a backing skilfully provided by vastly experienced musicians. See <a href=\"http://www.alexandralegouix.biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.alexandralegouix.biz/</a> for more info and details. <br><br>Winning BBC Introducing in January 2010 has helped launch Alexandra into the limelight and provided her with new and exciting opportunities. In April, Alexandra and her newly formed band (The Sunflowers!) played the BBC Introducing gig in reading with much success - landing new gigs as a result and developing a bigger and more loyal fanbase. As a result, AL &amp; The Sunflowers have been asked to go in to the BBC Berkshire radio station for an interview and two tracks! They have also been invited to perform on the main stage at the Inside:Outside Festival in Reading on Saturday 7th August! As well as support from the BBC, they have received much press attention and recently have had featured articles in local and national newspapers."
