From a theme aspect we can intrepidly consider it as a concept album, dedicated to the ‘big figures’ of the polish and world cinema.<br><br>What comes to the music – the CD is very compact, enriched with dynamic patterns, creating a self-collage. Like a picture of a good director. Lebowski holds listeners in tension, changing the moods, playing according to emotions. Complex and multidimensional compositions, are enabling a surprising and dynamic plot. The entirety is completed with rich instrumental use and the whole ensemble is an interesting arrangement, where the music isn’t held from being in some cases asthetic, modest and soft.<br>Lyrics for the “Cinematic” are original quotes adopted from the classical polish and international movies."

For Rhett May Indian culture and music mixed with that from the west. <br> There’s no doubt Rhett May is back to music, and his latest single...'Cocktails and Cannabis' setting fire to music charts across the globe....is the harbinger of a new era in music that is unique and a breath of fresh air !!As one scribe puts it...\"It's hypnotic...it's exotic...a love song with an edge that goes round and round inside your head....very Haight Ashbury \"........<br>"

No Name and his half-brother were raised by their mother, a single parent...Observing countless days of his mother working, and giving her all to support him and his brother was all No Name needed to see and understand how the world really worked as a kid. Watching his family grow apart, and past friends walk away, as if his opinions and leadership skills did not matter, has affected his psychological growth, while maintaining as an eccentric/artful individual who sees todays society as what he calls the \"phony maze\". According to No Name, it is this phony maze that is causing too many families to grow apart and seek unfocused paths, because of monetary greed. No Name's lyrical content scrapes the surface of real life issues, to the depths of political and corporate scandal, racism, religion and cultural pride. His platform is sure 2 grasp the mind of the so called intellectual, while providing poetic confidence to those who feel the system has failed them. No Name's - poetic thoughts - stem from the bases that everybody matters. He feels that Americas current state is due to false leadership, given to those who primarily have backgrounds that include monetary means, which promotes respect or fear of those who dont have a gift for leadership... No Name's societal evaluation has produced metaphorical thoughts that when blended together with \"literal reality\", reveal that God's soldiers are the \"unappealing thugs\", who fight for and speak the truth for change! Will the world listen, or continue on the very destructive path it created? With an, B.Sc. in Industrial Technology, from Ball State University, his path so far has been purely spiritual. He fears not the phony maze, but those who see the tattooed thug as a threat. Choice of words tell the real story, and most of all- \"If I Have No Vision, Then Life Iz Just Talk\" - No Name N."

Matt and I have played in numerous ensembles for years from big band to small ensembles but, this is our first time working together in a duo setting. Matt is one of the most sensitive players I have had the opportunity to ever perform with. HIs compositions are both beautiful and poignant creations I had the pleasure to perform on this recording.<br>   All six of my compositions on \"In The Sky\" are very different in style or feel and all were composed for people and places in my life's experience. \"Miles Away\" was written while doing more than 10 years of road travel gigging in the 1980s. In The Sky is a circular melody that never seems to end. It was actually written while I was floating in the sky of a waking lucid dream. Sometimes dreams do come true and can become real music! \"Forever More\" is thru-composed love song written in the jazz waltz feel. It also has lyrics which I hope to someday record with a vocalist. \"Lionel\" is a traditional 1940s style jazz swing ballad composed as a tribute to my first saxophone teacher and mentor, Lionel Soares, who unfortunately passed away in July 2009. Lionel had a great influence on my life in music. This composition and performance recreates Lionel's style and grace as I remember him dearly. \"My Mama\" is a tribute to my Mom, Evie Britto, written in the traditional Cape Verdean rhythmic style called the Coladeira. \"Starry Eyed Girl\" is my take on the classic tune, Star Eyes, written as a tribute to my girl friend, Kathy Crowley, who is the female vocalist that brightens the stage in performance with the folk group, Pumpkin Head Ted.<br><br>LINER NOTES FROM MATT RICHARD:<br>   This recent collaboration with Rick Britto has been very positive.  We have known each other for the past twenty years and have played together in many jazz settings, but not as a duo until now.  Rick has an amazing technical capacity on the tenor saxophone but he also plays with a tremendous amount of feeling.  His interpretations of each melody are unique and well conceived.  Rick is also a very good jazz pianist and that kept me on my toes for this session.  I appreciate his ability to not only compose and perform this project but to record and edit it as well.<br>   I consider all five of my compositions on \"In The Sky\" fairly straight-ahead in form, melody, and harmony.  The rhythms are based on traditional swing, Latin-American, and ballad styles with plenty of space in which can players can improvise. \"Side Step\" has loose connections to Lee Morgan’s composition \"Ceora\".  It was inspired by the original introduction that I used for that song on my first CD. \"Past\" was originally written and set in a different key as part of a collection of duets that I wrote for the bassist Bronek Suchanek.  This song and that complete duo project will hopefully be recorded someday soon. The choro rhythm of \"Strait Ahead\" is typically Brazilian and the feel of this song came through listening to pianist Alan Pasqua’s composition Highway as well as the music of composer and bandleader Maria Schneider. \"Swingin’ At The Columns\" is a tribute to two of my favorite jazz musicians of all time, Dave McKenna and Dick Johnson, who performed at a club called The Columns on Cape Cod for many years. Finally, \"A Song For Semenya\" was influenced by my collaborations over the years with jazz vocalist Semenya McCord.  Although in meter of 3/4, it has a bit of Horace Silver’s Song For My Father and other gospel roots in it.<br>"

Devin Messina Creative minds can’t be bottled in and they must wander freely through, soaking up as much as they can. Devin Messina is no exception. Born in Maryland, Devin’s broad upbringing has allowed her to witness the good and the bad of the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Music was her therapy, and despite her circumstances, she used melody to get through whatever was in her way. Devin first knew that she wanted to perform when she was only 10 years old. Locking the door, and performing in her room, she wrote her first song when she was 12. These early writings were reminiscent of the things that she’d been going through as a youngster. Devin’s drive was apparent very early on. She was able to record in a studio by the age of 12 with her first group, Girl’s In Full Effect (G.I.F.E.). While singing in talent shows in and around DC, Devin also sang in her school choirs and had the opportunity to sing the National Anthem for basketball games. While attending Fort Washington’s Friendly High School, Devin formed a group named “Elation”. After high school, the group started working on an album with producers K.C and Rich Harris. The group would spend days in the studio until they had their songs perfect. Over time the group would experience great creative differences, freeing Devin to pursue her dreams of being a solo artist. Despite her humble beginnings, Devin has been able to make a name for herself in the entertainment industry. She’s worked with very talented producers, like Rich Harris, Lex-D of Bloq Rockaz Production, and Mac Ming. She’s also opened up for artist like Beanie Man, A.Z., Chuck Brown, Marcus Johnson and Trey Songz. She’s also sang the National Anthem at a National Basketball Association Indiana Pacers game. In addition, her talent has given her a chance to perform at very prestigious venues, like the Lincoln Theater, Warner Theater, and Blues Alley. Inspired by Jimmy Hendrix, Bootsy Collins, Betty Davis, Smokey Robinson, Sam Cook, Aretha Franklin, Donnie Hathaway, Michael Jackson, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin, Devin consults a vast library of musical geniuses. Her style is a perfect blend of funk, soul, rock, and pop, and she strives to create music that is similar to nothing else that’s currently being done. A true artist in every sense of the word, Devin spends her spare time perfecting her other creative talents. She enjoys creating abstract drawings, writing, and cosmetology. She is passionate about everything that she touches and works on. Devin hopes to pursue a career in acting in theater and on screen. She also would love to start a clothing line, which would display some of her abstract drawings. From homelessness, to death, to broken hearts, to love pains, Devin’s life is filled with experiences that her listeners can relate to. She has a story to tell, and she hopes that people can learn from the things that she’s experience through her passionate music. “The negative life experiences that you go through shouldn’t dictate your future,” Devin proclaims, “everything happens for a reason, so just live life and learn from it all.” We hope that the world will soon be able to learn through Ms. Devin Messina."

They have previously worked together in various bands and music projects, but the current set “Steve Misik &amp; Co.” settled in April 2013 during the recording of the songs for the debut album “Schizoemphatic” and creating the promo video for the cover version of Deep Purple's ¨You Keep On Moving¨.<br><br>The way in which we got to the recording of the debut album was very long and difficult. The first single because of the web administrator's mistake was promoted with incorrect band name “Clone co.”, because he entered the name of the single instead the name of the band, so we kicked his ass.<br><br>When the band worked on new songs for the debut album faced with the biggest misfortune, with the health problems of the lead guitarist and co-founder of the band and especially a good friend. Steve Tóth had to be hospitalized. Steve Misik had to play abroad as a session musician in different projects, because of the break and money required for recording and so on. That time Steve Tóth suddenly passed away, which painfully affected everybody, because of his creative benefit, friendship and enormous love for music (when he found out that he will not be able to play guitar after his heart surgery, he fell into a coma and doctors failed to wake him). Steve Misik composed and arranged the song \"My waves\" based on his riff and lyrics, they worked together on that song before his death. The album Schizoemphatic is dedicated to his memory.<br>The band doesn't like to label its genre. We grew up listening hard rock, metal bands but we've been influenced by funk, soul, blues, classical music or jazz. Our music is based on the concept of trying different genres, different imaginary worlds, different fantasies in every song but keeping our own face. In the lyrics we point out the civilization problems of the society and mental world of the human being. That's how we define our music direction in the media interviews.<br>"

At age 11, in the Summer of 1978, I was a member of the Cleveland Orchestra Boy's Choir performing Carl Orff's \"Carmina Burana\" at Blossom Music and am hopeful this isn’t my only 15 minutes of fame in life. Got my first electric guitar from a garage sale at age 16 and taught myself how to play Stairway to Heaven since it just didn't sound right on piano. <br><br>After completing two years at Thee Ohio State University's School of Music, decided to move to Hollywood, California in July of 1989 and graduated from Musician's Institute/Guitar Institute of Technology - actually quite an accomplishment considering the vast majority didn't. Was signed to Rag Records with my band, The Mustard Seeds and as a producer for the band, Treehouse Toys for Planet Earth Records. While on Planet Earth, played at the first anniversary of 9/11 for a benefit promoted by KROQ. Even licensed Music to Playboy Entertainment for their cable channel that gave me a certain infamous reputation around town. Took my first stab at composing to film when I composed Title and Credit Cues for the Independent Film, \"Man's Best Friend\" (Maxwell Productions). Signed a Development Deal with the Entertainment Law Firm, Madison Law Group (my first dealing with entertainment lawyers) and produced a ballad for recording artist, Satori. Signed a Development Deal with Cornerstone Studios (Fleetwood Mac, Motley Crue) to produce vocalist, Tami Johnson. Went back to school at UCLA Extension School's Film Scoring Certificate Program and composed for Chamber Orchestras, Small Ensembles, Quintets, Quartets, and Trios that I do consider my greatest educational experience to date. <br><br>In May of 2003, I moved back to The FarEast Side of Cleveland, Ohio because of a family tragedy and created WhitedOut Productions &amp; Studio on Murray Hill producing seven Cds for commercial release including Jim Miller’s double CD, In-Trance-It: an absolute thrill since I have been following him since Oroboros. Considering the fact that my recording studio was in an art gallery building, performed live at Murray Hill Art Walks, SPARX Gallery Hops, and Fashion Shows. Performed with vocalist, Susan Fletcher at The Abbey Road on the River Festival in Louisville, KY and Louise Harrison, George's sister, complimented us for our version of \"Imagine\". Got back into Film/Television composing and contributed music to the Cleveland-based television series, \"Out of Darkness\" including the Main Theme (see YouTube interview above). Then went on to produce the Cd entitled, \"HARP ROCK\" for Harpist, Christina Kline performing 14 Classic Rock standards that never sound so serene. Also produced Christina's harp version of ZZ Top’s, “Gimme All Your Lovin’ ” for the FOX Television show, “BONES” and learned a lot about The Industry through dealings with Fox's Music division. Was thrilled when Northern Ohio Live Magazine’s television show, “Live from the Circle” used my song, \"Cool Jazz for Ma'\" for their main theme for a 13 week run on PBS. Played solo two years in a row at the Let's Get Together Festival in a natural amphitheater in Central, PA and have decided playing at outdoor music festivals is the way to go. <br><br>Then in 2012, moved back to HollyWeird and out there, I am know as a \"he played a mean guitar\" and formed my first cover band, The WizGuys. Got to jam a Zep medley of Whole Lotta Love/The Lemon Song/Bring On Home in the old clubs I used to play in with The Mustard Seeds - a total kick. But, there is a reason why Axl wrote, \"Welcome To The Jungle\" and I got the hell outta Dodge. <br><br>Returned back to the Cleveland area in 2014 and became the keyboardist at Unity Center of the Heights which not only enhanced my performance skills, but my Spiritual skills as well. Formed a cover band that we play the first part of a cover, then jam on it for an undetermined amount of time. And now I am concentrating on my Cool Jazz &amp; R&amp;B music plus a new cover band with electric rock harpist Kristy Kline entitled - Into The Light: A Pink Floyd Experience that Kristy sings and plays harp to!"

        "extra": "Craymo BIO<br><br>Craymo was born Craig Stephen Raymo in Massena, New York and grew up in nearby Ogdensburg, a quiet little city on the St. Lawrence River bordering Canada. Music seemed to possess his soul from an early age as he had always tried to imitate the singers and bands eminating from his little 45 rpm record player. In 3rd grade he picked up the alto saxophone taking lessons from Kenneth Van Winkle, father of future Grammy winner Dixon Van Winkle. Craymo continued taking lessons and played in elementary and Jr. and Sr.High Bands and the school Jazz Rock group. Craig wrote his first song when he was 16. He sang in the school choir from elementary through high school. The young performer craved the stage and graced it every chance he got joining the local vaudeville style minstrel group Showtime. Craymo performed in community theatre and high school drama and musical theatre productions. <br>As a senior in high school he took interest in DJing and got a job spinning at Big Ed's Dallas Lounge and also at a local radio station where co-workers first started calling him Craymo. Craymo went to Fredonia State University majoring in Broadcasting with a minor in drama. <br><br>Feeling the call of the big city, Craig left college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dreams. He soon landed acting gigs in the TV soap operas General Hospital and days Of Our livess, most recently in the HBO original film Recount. Craymo continued to DJ in Nightclubs and was one of the first \"video jocks\" to beat mix videos! All the while focused on his music Craymo wrote hundreds of songs and started recording demos in Los Angeles recording studios. He auditioned to be the lead singer for several bands but ultimately realized his destiny was to be a solo artist. The determined young man took vocal lessons with R&amp;B great Bobby Womack and recorded a demo of one of his songs. Craymo then met record producer David Longoria who took him under his wing and they recorded his first professionally recorded song Love Touch and filmed his first music video. Then they went on to create several more songs including Craymo's first EP entitled Be My Girl who's title track was licensed in the indie film Paper Thin Immortals. The next video was Take It Slow with a sixties beatnick vibe and the song was licensed in the indie film Accidents Don't Happen. Craymo appeared as a male vocalist on Star Search 89 with Ed McMahan. He formed several backup bands performing at the Whiskey A Go Go, The Roxy, Genghis Cohen and opened up shows for Smashmouth, The Plimsouls and Fishbone. He then met record producer Chris Irwin and recorded several songs in his Malibu studio. Craymo then ran into his old friend, songwriter and producer Brandon Jarrett. They went into the studio and magic happened. Combining their song catalogs into one company, Moho Productions, LLC. They recorded One Love One World which became a worldwide phenomenon being featured on the United Nations project UNESCO web site <a href=\"http://www.newsongsforpeace.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.newsongsforpeace.org</a>. School teachers all over the world downloaded the song, taught it to their students who then performed it at their schools in the USA, Canada, China and Australia! <br><br>Craymo has been a semi-finalist and finalist in several songwriting competitions including the 2014 Hollywood Music In Media Awards, 2014 Right Out TV Awards, 2014 Indie Music Channel Awards, 2014 Independent Music Network Awards (Winner New Discovery Artist), 2014 UK Songwriting Competition and the 2012 Australian Music Oz Awards. His songs have been licensed in the indie films, Culture Shock, Gabe The Cupid Dog, Super Southern Sweet Sixteen, Silly Movie 2 and Successful Failures 2. Also in television including The Mysteries Of Laura,  The X Games<br>( ESPN), Dance Mom's (TLC), The Orlando Citrus Parade, Sinbad's Reality U (pilot), Toddlers and Tiaras (TLC) and Chris and John To The Rescue (Canada).

Music seemed to possess his soul from an early age as he had always tried to imitate the singers and bands eminating from his little 45 rpm record player.  In 3rd grade he picked up the alto saxophone taking lessons from Kenneth Van Winkle, father of future Grammy winner producer Dixon Van Winkle. Craymo continued taking lessons and played in elementary and Jr. and Sr.High Bands and the school Jazz Rock group. Craig wrote his first song when he was 16.  He sang in the school choir from elementary through high school.  The young performer craved the stage and graced it every chance he got joining the local vaudeville style minstrel group Showtime. Craymo performed in community theatre and high school drama and musical theatre productions.<br>As a senior in high school he took interest in DJing and got a job spinning at Big Ed's Dallas Lounge and also at a local radio station where co-workers first started calling him Craymo.  Craymo went to Fredonia State University majoring in Broadcasting with a minor in drama."

Then when Hurricane Katrina hit, many My Space fans answered my call when I created the Paul Caroul Challenge: a pledge to follow my lead and give half of what you own to help the victims get back on their feet. So many wonderful people donated stuff that I could give to the right places to expedite the process. I later located one gal who came to CA with her car and the shirt off her back after losing everything- and around the country Madison Paige fans sent gift cards, goods, etc. and together we were able to help furnish her new dwellings. Everyone who would gave half, I pledged that I would record a specialty CD for and it is now done exclusively for them and a few of my friends. It took just under two years in between my Madison Paige recordings. My heart was warmed by others' generosity to help, and so the project truly became a Labor Of Love. \" Quote: -Paul Caroul February 2007<br><br>"

One of these concerts was Satsup Tin Cup Races in Olympia, Washington, then we came down and played Portland, Oregon, San Fransisco, California and then ended up in Hollywood in early 1971. I was the founder of the Johnathan Davis Group. I wrote all the songs and was the lead singer. I played in Hollywood in the 70's, was on KTTV, The Elliot Mence show, I played on KPFK Live after 12:00, I did a Griffith Park concert with El Chicano and played many living room concerts for the rich and famous I also played The Trubador and Filthy McNasty's. The Johnathan Davis Group was the only group ever to play live on KMET at that time. Recorded at Fat chance, Columbia Studio D and at their showcase, also recorded at Paramount Studios, where i met Frank Zappa and his family, Played these clubs outside The L.A. area, Finicans Rainbow, The In Crowd ,The Golden Bear are just a few of the clubs I played in. I have been on the same shows with Steve Miller Band, The Youngbloods, Bad Company, Big Foot, Little Feet, El Chicano, Ike and Tina Turner, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Linda Ronstadt, Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids, John Hammond, Country Joe and the Fish and many more that I can't recall. Gene Borges had my back- he was the owner of Sunset Transit Classic Cars down by The Hyatt House and he showed me the best of Hollywood. My best friend was Michael Todd, Elizabeth Taylors son. Mike was delivering gold for Howard Hughes. Mike introduced me to him and we were the ones who took Liz's fragrance White Diamonds to the manufacturer. I ended up selling a Rolls Royce to Wilt Chamberlain and I met Ricky Nelson and his two sons there on the car lot. I burned a fat one with Buddy Miles. It was the early '70's, what can I say, ya know? I met Cindy Lauper, we hung out for a day. I also met David Bowie. Thanks goes out all my fans old and new :)"

One of these concerts was Satsup Tin Cup Races in Olympia, Washington, then we came down and played Portland, Oregon, San Fransisco, California and then ended up in Hollywood in early 1971. I was the founder of the Johnathan Davis Group. I wrote all the songs and was the lead singer. I played in Hollywood in the 70's, was on KTTV, The Elliot Mence show, I played on KPFK Live after 12:00, I did a Griffith Park concert with El Chicano and played many living room concerts for the rich and famous I also played The Trubador and Filthy McNasty's. The Johnathan Davis Group was the only group ever to play live on KMET at that time. Recorded at Fat chance, Columbia Studio D and at their showcase, also recorded at Paramount Studios, where i met Frank Zappa and his family, Played these clubs outside The L.A. area, Finicans Rainbow, The In Crowd ,The Golden Bear are just a few of the clubs I played in. I have been on the same shows with Steve Miller Band, The Youngbloods, Bad Company, Big Foot, Little Feet, El Chicano, Ike and Tina Turner, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Linda Ronstadt, Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids, John Hammond, Country Joe and the Fish and many more that I can't recall. Gene Borges had my back- he was the owner of Sunset Transit Classic Cars down by The Hyatt House and he showed me the best of Hollywood. My best friend was Michael Todd, Elizabeth Taylors son. Mike was delivering gold for Howard Hughes. Mike introduced me to him and we were the ones who took Liz's fragrance White Diamonds to the manufacturer. I ended up selling a Rolls Royce to Wilt Chamberlain and I met Ricky Nelson and his two sons there on the car lot. I burned a fat one with Buddy Miles. It was the early '70's, what can I say, ya know? I met Cindy Lauper, we hung out for a day. I also met David Bowie. Thanks goes out all my fans old and new :)"

We make music that people can relate to on many different levels... think about it... chill to it... dance to it... make love to it... funky, modern, relevant lyrics and tunes, set to a backing skilfully provided by vastly experienced musicians. See <a href=\"http://www.alexandralegouix.biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.alexandralegouix.biz/</a> for more info and details. <br><br>Winning BBC Introducing in January 2010 has helped launch Alexandra into the limelight and provided her with new and exciting opportunities. In April, Alexandra and her newly formed band (The Sunflowers!) played the BBC Introducing gig in reading with much success - landing new gigs as a result and developing a bigger and more loyal fanbase. As a result, AL &amp; The Sunflowers have been asked to go in to the BBC Berkshire radio station for an interview and two tracks! They have also been invited to perform on the main stage at the Inside:Outside Festival in Reading on Saturday 7th August! As well as support from the BBC, they have received much press attention and recently have had featured articles in local and national newspapers."

One of these concerts was Satsup Tin Cup Races in Olympia, Washington, then we came down and played Portland, Oregon, San Fransisco, California and then ended up in Hollywood in early 1971. I was the founder of the Johnathan Davis Group. I wrote all the songs and was the lead singer. I played in Hollywood in the 70's, was on KTTV, The Elliot Mence show, I played on KPFK Live after 12:00, I did a Griffith Park concert with El Chicano and played many living room concerts for the rich and famous I also played The Trubador and Filthy McNasty's. The Johnathan Davis Group was the only group ever to play live on KMET at that time. Recorded at Fat chance, Columbia Studio D and at their showcase, also recorded at Paramount Studios, where i met Frank Zappa and his family, Played these clubs outside The L.A. area, Finicans Rainbow, The In Crowd ,The Golden Bear are just a few of the clubs I played in. I have been on the same shows with Steve Miller Band, The Youngbloods, Bad Company, Big Foot, Little Feet, El Chicano, Ike and Tina Turner, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Linda Ronstadt, Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids, John Hammond, Country Joe and the Fish and many more that I can't recall. Gene Borges had my back- he was the owner of Sunset Transit Classic Cars down by The Hyatt House and he showed me the best of Hollywood. My best friend was Michael Todd, Elizabeth Taylors son. Mike was delivering gold for Howard Hughes. Mike introduced me to him and we were the ones who took Liz's fragrance White Diamonds to the manufacturer. I ended up selling a Rolls Royce to Wilt Chamberlain and I met Ricky Nelson and his two sons there on the car lot. I burned a fat one with Buddy Miles. It was the early '70's, what can I say, ya know? I met Cindy Lauper, we hung out for a day. I also met David Bowie. Thanks goes out all my fans old and new :)"

Having 4 singing sisters and Banjo playing dad, music was a major influence in the home growing up.<br>He has always enjoyed playing along with his dad at home. When his father would rehearse, Courtney would have his plastic guitar that his dad bought him and from there he started to watch people playing, began school music lessons and eventually took everything and built a style of his own, along the way learning to play the Bass Guitar, Keyboards and Drum. Gaining experience whilst playing in Church led to Courtney playing in session forums and progressing to working in the studio applying his skills to production and writing.<br><br>He has been a musician for the best part of 25 years, gaining respect as a guitarist and building a good reputation playing guitar on the gospel circuit. Courtney has played on many projects and live performances.<br><br>He has been privileged to work with a lot of musicians, soloists and choirs over the years. The likes of<br>London Community Gospel Choir, <br>Noel Robinson, <br>Visual Ministry Choir,<br>Kingdom Choir, <br>Marvin Sapp (USA), <br>Vicky Winans (USA), <br>Jennifer Philips, <br>The Wade Bro's and<br>Ian Green<br>Trinity girls school Christmas show<br>New Testament church, school of music teaching guitar.<br>Italy Gospel music festival<br>New Years Eve music festival Scotland<br> to name a few.<br><br>As a writer and producer Courtney is always keen to support young talent and features them on tracks to help them develop and grow. Working with the youth a lot, he has seen the ability and determination that is out there so he wants to at least offer a helping hand to open the door for them. <br>He has worked hard to achieve what he has already produced in the music field and continues to spread the knowledge and experiences he has obtained over the years.<br>"

Born in Chicago, and raised on Robert Johnson, Johnny Cash and Stevie Ray Vaughn, RYAN MORENO displays a songwriting maturity that is older than his years. RYAN has honed his acoustic guitar and piano playing to a sharp edge that drives his lyrics and moves his audience. RYAN's music has evolved into progressive pop-blues-rock with a touch of style from John Mayer. RYAN's lyrics tell stories people relate to, as he sings of heart moving inklings of love, personal loss, and the greater human condition that is so much a part of his innate understanding of the blues. His own life has not been simple, but his optimism comes through in his up beat numbers that lift the soul.

I’ve seen them play about fifty times and I still want more!” Actor/comedian Andy Dick is also on board: “All Day Sucker’s ‘Worst Case Scenario’ makes me wanna shake my ass.” And Kelly Osbourne says, “I f***ing love them!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Following up their Self Titled debut album produced by Evan Frankfort (Wallflowers, Pete Yorn) and Warren Huart (The Fray, Aerosmith)  is The Big Pretend. Part adoring valentine, part cleverly biting commentary on their hometown, All Day Sucker’s new album is a full length bona fide concept album written by Coyle and Summers that shows their pride in L.A. even as it pokes fun at the occasional ridiculousness and idiosyncrasies of a city where everyone has some connection to the film industry. Produced by Noah Shain (Orson, As Tall As Lions, Dead Sarah) and released on the duo’s label Trademark Entertainment/big WOW music, the set is an inspired twist on the sounds of the classic rock era reinvented for modern ears.<br><br>You can watch their video for “The Picture (That Took Me)” at by clicking here."

Songwriting Competition. They Have Licensed Tracks To ABC’s “Happy Endings”, CBS’ “Swingtown”, MTV’s“Laguna Beach”, “The Hills”, “The Real World\", “Road Rules” and “Breaking Bonaduce”<br><br>          <br>Former Maroon 5 drummer Ryan Dusick is a huge fan: “All Day Sucker plays soulful pop music, classic grooves with a velvety voice singing cleverly ironic lyrics. I’ve seen them play about fifty times and I still want more!” Actor/comedian Andy Dick is also on board: “All Day Sucker’s ‘Worst Case Scenario’ makes me wanna shake my ass.” And Kelly Osbourne says, “I f***ing love them!”<br>            <br>Following up their Self Titled debut album produced by Evan Frankfort (Wallflowers, Pete Yorn) and Warren Huart (The Fray, Aerosmith) is The Big Pretend. Part adoring valentine, part cleverly biting commentary on their hometown, All Day Sucker’s new album is a full length bona fide concept album written by Coyle and Summers that shows their pride in L.A. even as it pokes fun at the occasional ridiculousness and idiosyncrasies of a city where everyone has some connection to the film industry. Produced by Noah Shain (Orson, As Tall As Lions, Dead Sarah) and released on the duo’s label Trademark Entertainment/big WOW music, the set is an inspired twist on the sounds of the classic rock era reinvented for modern ears.<br><br>You can watch their video for “The Picture (That Took Me)” at by clicking here."

        "extra": "Alex Hirsch is a musician/song-writer/producer born in 1966 in New York City. He learned to play the piano at 9 years old, while living in Reseda California. A couple of years later he found weed and the Beatles, and begged his mother for a guitar. 30 years later, Alex is still rockin' daily, collaborating with such notables as Elliot Randall, Ice-T, Too Short, Black Silver, BIONIK, Griffen and several other great talents in several musical genres. Currently he is working on his third solo record titled Tick Tock Clock, due out very soon! He also has several videos up on YOUTUBE, just search for Alex Hirsch and some reference able material will emerge. (We all love you tube). Alex Hirsch is the son of the legendary television and theater actor, Judd Hirsch, who played “Alex Reiger” on the hit show TAXI, which aired on ABC and CBS from 1977-1983. Judd then landed on another hit television show, called \"Dear John\". His third success starring in another top rated TV show on CBS called \"NUMB3RS\", where he played the father of two brothers, an FBI agent and a mathematician who solve crimes together using the latest mathematical techniques.  Alex thanks any and every-one for any support, constructive criticism, money, time, energy and other human blessings he has received throughout his crazy life. Our sincere hope at Key Wins Productions is that by continuing to produce music from the heart, with real instruments played by real people, we can keep the world from fading into “Cosmic Reality TV.” If you agree with us, kindly go to CD BABY and buy one of Alex's 1997 release titled \"Naturally\", mixed and recorded at The Monkey House in Chicago, featuring all the members from his colossal band, IMPRASIA, a brilliant 17 song collection engineered and produced by BIONIK!"

        "extra": "My name is Giuseppe (Joe) Lo Cascio and I’m from Altavilla Milicia (PA), a small town about  20 km from Palermo (Sicily). I lived as a young boy, in United States of America in Chicago (Illinois) and then, at the age of 14 years, I returned back to Sicily where, currently, I live and work. At the age of 9 years  I started to \"strum\" with the first chords basics of my electric guitar, received  as a gift from my father. For several years, always a boy, I was member of a local band (playing and learning the first notions of percussion). I had over the years, mainly due to lack of time and space, neglecting the music, then, to resume with greater commitment, in the last decade. In this period, in fact, mostly, of self-taught, but also with the help of a real musician/violinist from Altavilla Milicia (my brother in law), I found the \"real\" basics/essentials of music. I struggle, in fact, trying constantly to perfect myself, with different musical instruments. Sound percussion (drums), tenor sax, electric guitar,  singing. Recently, not having the music borders, I'm dedicating my time to the development of various musical projects unpublished. In particular, with the experience and collaboration of Phil Di Carlo (original from Roccapalumba (PA), that has also the same music passion, I'm deepening the sector, very complex, of creating new midi bases/unreleased songs. Together with Di Carlo, we have, in fact, composed some songs and others have in work. Alone, with \"real\" passion, we have created: the rhythm, melody, the lyric, arrangement, recording, etc ... In connection with these songs, in fact, having received several positive consensus, we decided to put them into circulation, making them listen to the users of the Internet, interacting with them, using  this space. For some of these \"unreleased songs\" (those that we have a specific meaning) we have, also, created video- clips, \"home made\" by us and/or some friend of ours. In this page, you can, then, if curious, listen fully, those tracks. Taking into account that are song’s are in English (almost all), you can also find the corresponding translation \"synthetic\" in Italian language. Sometimes, when it’s possible to do it, being a member SIAE, in accordance with all the regulations ENPLAS, I participate/organize various musical events in the local environment. Not  being able to spread \"covers\", for obvious copyright reasons, although I like playing/singing C.Santana music; F.Papetti sax style and Buble/Sinatra/Amstrong’s song’s,  we have therefore decided, with my friend Phil, to provide \"Internet surfers\" something  of \"ours\". Music  is  something  special that  help’s us to communicate and we find it, every single day, around us. In my case it’s part of my life.  In my case, whatever people think about it, I’m sure that music is something that’s part of my life.  <br><br>"

At the age of 9 years  I started to \"strum\" with the first chords basics of my electric guitar, received  as a gift from my father. For several years, always a boy, I was member of a local band (playing and learning the first notions of percussion).

In this period, in fact, mostly, of self-taught, but also with the help of a real musician/violinist from Altavilla Milicia (my brother in law), I found the \"real\" basics/essentials of music. I struggle, in fact, trying constantly to perfect myself, with different musical instruments. Sound percussion (drums), tenor sax, electric guitar,  singing. Recently, not having the music borders, I'm dedicating my time to the development of various musical projects unpublished. In particular, with the experience and collaboration of Phil Di Carlo (original from Roccapalumba (PA), that has also the same music passion, I'm deepening the sector, very complex, of creating new midi bases/unreleased songs. Together with Di Carlo, we have, in fact, composed some songs and others have in work. Alone, with \"real\" passion, we have created: the rhythm, melody, the lyric, arrangement, recording, etc ... In connection with these songs, in fact, having received several positive consensus, we decided to put them into circulation, making them listen to the users of the Internet, interacting with them, using  this space. For some of these \"unreleased songs\" (those that we have a specific meaning) we have, also, created video- clips, \"home made\" by us and/or some friend of ours. In this page, you can, then, if curious, listen fully, those tracks. Taking into account that are song’s are in English (almost all), you can also find the corresponding translation \"synthetic\" in Italian language. Sometimes, when it’s possible to do it, being a member SIAE, in accordance with all the regulations ENPLAS, I participate/organize various musical events in the local environment. Not  being able to spread \"covers\", for obvious copyright reasons, although I like playing/singing C.Santana music; F.Papetti sax style and Buble/Sinatra/Amstrong’s song’s,  we have therefore decided, with my friend Phil, to provide \"Internet surfers\" something  of \"ours\". Music  is  something  special that  help’s us to communicate and we find it, every single day, around us. In my case it’s part of my life.

I lived as a young boy, in United States of America in Chicago (Illinois) and then, at the age of 14 years, I returned back to Sicily where, currently, I live and work. At the age of 9 years  I started to \"strum\" with the first chords basics of my electric guitar, received  as a gift from my father. For several years, always a boy, I was member of a local band (playing and learning the first notions of percussion). I had over the years, mainly due to lack of time and space, neglecting the music, then, to resume with greater commitment, in the last decade. In this period, in fact, mostly, of self-taught, but also with the help of a real musician/violinist from Altavilla Milicia (my brother in law), I found the \"real\" basics/essentials of music. I struggle, in fact, trying constantly to perfect myself, with different musical instruments. Sound percussion (drums), tenor sax, electric guitar,  singing. Recently, not having the music borders, I'm dedicating my time to the development of various musical projects unpublished. In particular, with the experience and collaboration of Phil Di Carlo (original from Roccapalumba (PA), that has also the same music passion, I'm deepening the sector, very complex, of creating new midi bases/unreleased songs. Together with Di Carlo, we have, in fact, composed some songs and others have in work. Alone, with \"real\" passion, we have created: the rhythm, melody, the lyric, arrangement, recording, etc ... In connection with these songs, in fact, having received several positive consensus, we decided to put them into circulation, making them listen to the users of the Internet, interacting with them, using  this space. For some of these \"unreleased songs\" (those that we have a specific meaning) we have, also, created video- clips, \"home made\" by us and/or some friend of ours. In this page, you can, then, if curious, listen fully, those tracks. Taking into account that are song’s are in English (almost all), you can also find the corresponding translation \"synthetic\" in Italian language. Sometimes, when it’s possible to do it, being a member SIAE, in accordance with all the regulations ENPLAS, I participate/organize various musical events in the local environment. Not  being able to spread \"covers\", for obvious copyright reasons, although I like playing/singing C.Santana music; F.Papetti sax style and Buble/Sinatra/Amstrong’s song’s,  we have therefore decided, with my friend Phil, to provide \"Internet surfers\" something  of \"ours\". Music  is  something  special that  help’s us to communicate and we find it, every single day, around us. In my case it’s part of my life.  What ever people think about it, I’m sure that music is something that’s part of my life.  <br><br>"

All songs written by Nick Schinder (music) and Jacqui Doherty (lyrics), except “Elephant &amp; Castle” (lyrics &amp; music by Nick Schinder)<br><br>Nick &amp; Jacqui agree that the name Deep River Running, ''reflects well our attitude &amp; style of music.''<br>Personnel: Nick Schinder: Vocals, keyboards &amp; guitars.

        "extra": "Villanova Junction was formed in 2007. First being hypnotized by such bands as Iggy Pop, the Doors and the Misfits. Now a days the members of the band have become more eclectic in their range of music. The resemblance of bands such as Cream, the Black Keys, Arcade Fire and the Beatles has inspired the bands musical interests to become extremely abundant in terms of their own creativity. They do not wish to be labeled in one genre, but many. More instrumentals, more harmonies, more melodies. Villanova Junction wants to create in the form that keeps the audience involved and interested...always. The members of the band also feel as though there is a connection involved with the audience. Something that you feel is coming from the bands heart and is transformed into something beautiful. It's a sense of awareness, a sense of deep pleasure that fills the mind with satisfaction for audience members. You leave the show knowing that it was indeed a show. Villanova Junction wanted to capture that same essence on their self debut album \"11:11\" which feature 16 tracks that cover everything from 60's snap mod beats to melodic and dramatic instrumentals. The baritone voice is not too common in the music industry these days and it sure is glad to hear someone who can yelp like they got a pair. The album is definitely a great one to listen to. Single tracks include \"Devil is the man\", \"Drink with the Dead\" , \"Silence\" and \"Fractal of Love.\" Be sure to listen to the full album from start to finish so that you may get that full effect... that essence which permeates from the heart of the band."

        "extra": "My name is Giuseppe (Joe) Lo Cascio and I’m from Altavilla Milicia (PA), a small town about  20 km from Palermo (Sicily). I lived as a young boy, in United States of America in Chicago (Illinois) and then, at the age of 14 years, I returned back to Sicily where, currently, I live and work. At the age of 9 years  I started to \"strum\" with the first chords basics of my electric guitar, received  as a gift from my father. For several years, always a boy, I was member of a local band (playing and learning the first notions of percussion). I had over the years, mainly due to lack of time and space, neglecting the music, then, to resume with greater commitment, in the last decade. In this period, in fact, mostly, of self-taught, but also with the help of a real musician/violinist from Altavilla Milicia (my brother in law), I found the \"real\" basics/essentials of music. I struggle, in fact, trying constantly to perfect myself, with different musical instruments. Sound percussion (drums), tenor sax, electric guitar,  singing. Recently, not having the music borders, I'm dedicating my time to the development of various musical projects unpublished. In particular, with the experience and collaboration of Phil Di Carlo (original from Roccapalumba (PA), that has also the same music passion, I'm deepening the sector, very complex, of creating new midi bases/unreleased songs. Together with Di Carlo, we have, in fact, composed some songs and others have in work. Alone, with \"real\" passion, we have created: the rhythm, melody, the lyric, arrangement, recording, etc ... In connection with these songs, in fact, having received several positive consensus, we decided to put them into circulation, making them listen to the users of the Internet, interacting with them, using  this space. For some of these \"unreleased songs\" (those that we have a specific meaning) we have, also, created video- clips, \"home made\" by us and/or some friend of ours. In this page, you can, then, if curious, listen fully, those tracks. Taking into account that are song’s are in English (almost all), you can also find the corresponding translation \"synthetic\" in Italian language. Sometimes, when it’s possible to do it, being a member SIAE, in accordance with all the regulations ENPLAS, I participate/organize various musical events in the local environment. Not  being able to spread \"covers\", for obvious copyright reasons, although I like playing/singing C.Santana music; F.Papetti sax style and Buble/Sinatra/Amstrong’s song’s,  we have therefore decided, with my friend Phil, to provide \"Internet surfers\" something  of \"ours\". Music  is  something  special that  help’s us to communicate and we find it, every single day, around us. In my case it’s part of my life.  What ever people think about it, I’m sure that music is something that’s part of my life.  <br><br>"

        "extra": "Combining equal parts country, folk, rock and Americana, singer/songwriter JOE WHYTE's songs have been described as \"alt-country pearls that shimmer with simplicity and effectiveness\" and \"beautifully crafted, melancholic Americana.\"<br><br>Dubbed, \"The King of NYC Americana\" by music blog Twangnation, Joe released the EP, WHEN THE DAY BREAKS, in June 2010.  It is a stripped-down, acoustic-based follow-up to 2007's critically acclaimed full-band album, Devil in the Details. Though primarily a solo affair, Joe is joined on a few songs by band members Catherine Popper (Jack White, Grace Potter, Ryan Adams) on bass and vocals, and Dan Marcus (Crescent &amp; Frost, Ana Egge) on guitar, dobro and mandolin.<br><br>The last 2 years have seen Joe play 4 unofficial showcases during the Americana Music Conference in Nashville, be selected the Sonicbids winner for the the \"A Taste of Triple A\" sampler and play the Bluebird Cafe stage on the Philadelphia stop of the \"Country Throwdown\" tour. Other highlights include playing WSM radio's stage on the historic Ryman Auditorium plaza for CMA Fest and opening dates for Jim Lauderdale, Justin Townes Earle, Darrell Scott, Alejandro Escovedo and Rosanne Cash.<br><br>Over the years, Joe has also performed throughout the US, UK and Ireland with artists such as Tony Joe White, Steve Forbert, Chuck Prophet, Cadillac Sky, Rod Picott, Amanda Shires, Slaid Cleaves, Lucy Kaplansky and Son Volt, to name a few.<br><br>Joe is currently endorsed by Elixir strings, and was a 5-year recipient of an ASCAPlus award, a merit-based songwriting grant from ASCAP. He is entering the studio with his band this summer to begin work on the full-length follow-up to his last EP.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT JOE WHYTE AND HIS EP, WHEN THE DAY BREAKS:<br><br>\"4 Stars. A modern-day troubadour, New York City-based Joe Whyte is a singer-songwriter in the grand tradition of Gordon Lightfoot, Jim<br>Weatherly and Mac Davis. He pens memorable songs that bridge folk, country, pop and soul in a craftsmanlike way, but never do they sound hackneyed or cliched. This six-track mini-album is full of the kind of songs that in the mid-1970s would’ve been covered by everyone from Val Doonican to Waylon Jennings, Gladys Knight to Linda Ronstadt. You’re unlikely to hear these songs covered on the radio today, so I suggest that you root around the internet and seek out this excellent recording. It will bring endless hours of listening pleasure.\" - Maverick Country (UK)<br><br>\"The King of NYC Americana.\" <br>4 Stars. \"Joe Whyte's new release, WHEN THE DAY BREAKS, is a slice of pop-Americana that straddles territory settled in the 70's by pioneers like Gordon Lightfoot and Stephen Stills and currently being reshaped by the likes of the Avett Brothers, Darrell Scott and Bruce Robison. Blending a pop songwriter's instinct for precision &amp; hook with the warmth &amp; authenticity in storytelling that are the trademarks of folk and country, Whyte rescues the much maligned genre and gives it beauty and depth\"  - Twangnation<br><br>\"Joe Whyte is really very good at what he does, his rootsy Americana/folk is beautifully executed...'This City Is Alive' (is) solemn yet tinged with hope, it sets the bar high and confirms that Whyte will be a force in this genre. 'Off To War', with it's strong Nashville harmonies, reminds me of Desire-era Dylan which is no bad thing. Everything you'd expect from a record of this type is there, subtle guitar, haunting harmonica and melancholic, occasionally sentimental lyrics, all pulled together by Whyte's strong voice.\" - For Folk's Sake<br><br>\"I can count only a handful of times that an artist has struck me as having 'it' within the first 10 seconds that I hear them. The last time was Justin Townes Earle. Now I can say that the last time was Joe Whyte!\" -Torchy Blaine, WDVR<br><br><br>AND HIS LAST ALBUM, DEVIL IN THE DETAILS:<br><br>\"<strong><strong> (4 stars). A significant achievement...The performance standard is high throughout...delicately crafted... Whyte's youthful tenor belies his maturity as a deft writer...it balances musical credibility with populist appeal in a way that is often made to look impossible by less adept artists. - MAVERICK COUNTRY (UK)<br><br>\"8 out of 10. Musically, the album is perfect. The title track is just beautiful, and the whole song is well arranged. 'Out of Tune' is again so fantastically arranged, and Joe's voice is really let to work on this song. I think with his talent for song writing he could really get some good results. Joe manages to portray warmth in his songs that really hits you hard, and its hard not to feel just a little melancholic when you hear his voice soar.\" - AMERICANA UK<br><br>\"Beautifully crafted, melancholic Americana...Joe Whyte knows how to deliver. Having established himself as a seamlessly consistent songwriter, Whyte's expressive lyrical ability is more evident than ever in his latest bunch of songs. His new LP speaks volumes about his tireless endeavour for perfection and being likened to certain stars such as Ryan Adams and Ray Lamontagne, Joe takes his place somewhere between the two, providing engaging and profound ballads for the new Americana generation.\" - Joel Crane, UK reviewer for NME, Mojo and Q<br><br>\"Joe Whyte is going to make history with this album, and you heard it here first...Impresses from the start...he launches himself straight into the circle of promising singer-songwriters who we simply have to keep our eye on. A must-buy album!!!\" - ROOTSVILLE.BE<br><br>\"BEST OF 2007! This album is why I love Americana music...a flat out great CD...I want to hear more...the guy's got it going on from the writing perspective...he sounds fantastic. Check him out!\" - AMERICANAROOTS.COM<br><br>\"</strong></strong> (4 stars)! What a damn good album this is! Whyte has put together a collection of songs that stick with you from the very first time you hear them. He is, in our opinion, the most promising artist of the near future. Buy it immediately! - CTRL.ALT.COUNTRY"
